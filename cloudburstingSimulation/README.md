This folder contains the script for the VDC/Cloud bursting simulator and 2 sets of input files for running it (which were used in the paper).

Run the command 'python cloudburstingSimulatin.py <file1>.txt_dagTimes_to_CSV.csv <file2>.txt._jobTimes_to_CSV.csv' with the two input files to run the simulation.

Customize simulation parameters additionally by putting '-f=x' when 'f' is a flag and 'x' is a value in the command. See the code for the full list of flags.
