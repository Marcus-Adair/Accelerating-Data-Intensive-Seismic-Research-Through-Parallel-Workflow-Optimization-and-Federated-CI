This file contains files to launch the FakeQuakes DAGMan Workflow remotely. See launch_FDW_remote_Description.pdf for instructions.

Note: One must have an OSG account with the FDW source code in their home repository. You must also edit in your own OSG host, username, and password in dag_v2_4_prepare_from_vdc.py and also generate an SSH key for your remote machine to add to your OSGconnect profile.
